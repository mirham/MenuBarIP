## Introduction
MirHam MenuBarIP is a macOS menu bar application designed to display your public and local IP addresses with various customization options.

## Why I made it? 
I was surprised to find that all similar applications in the App Store are paid and offer limited customization. Creating my own was not a big challenge, so now Iâ€™m sharing it with everyone.

## Features
- Highly customizable various menu bar items
- Periodic Internet connection checks
- Operates continuously, even after computer restarts

## Installation

Download the DMG installer from the [releases](https://github.com/mirham/MenuBarIP/releases), mount it, and drag and drop the application to the Applications folder. That's it! However, you will need to allow launching applications from unidentified developers to start the application, as I don't have an Apple developer license.

## Improvement
> [!TIP]
> If you have any ideas, thoughts, or concerns, don't hesitate to contact me. I'm happy to help and improve the application.

## Disclaimer
> [!WARNING]
> I'm not a professional Swift developer (though I am a professional .NET developer). All my macOS apps are made for personal use by myself and my family simply because I have the skills to create them (and for fun, of course ðŸ˜Š). If my application has caused any harm, I apologize for that, but please be aware that you use it at your own risk.
